I have without doubt developed new pseudo elements, the challenged was very fun to do, I just have not yet added the costume validator, since I am currently learning JS. Thus when I am done with it or start doing JS challenges I will pass by here as time goes by.

This challenge has made me feel confident with my HTML/CSS skills, now I just have to keep learning advanced skilleds bit by bit.
